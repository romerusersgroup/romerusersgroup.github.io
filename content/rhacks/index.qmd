R-Hacks specialises in short, focused examples that solve a concrete problem. No long tutorials, no heavy theory—just the exact piece of code you need right now.
From quick ggplot adjustments to clever data wrangling patterns, each snippet is built to be copied, adapted, and used immediately in your own analysis.

Beyond simple tricks, the blog highlights efficient ways of thinking about data.
You’ll find micro-workflows that combine tidyverse tools, reproducible visualisation techniques, and small utilities that make routine tasks easier. Every post aims to help you write cleaner, faster, and more robust R code by adopting sensible, modern practices.

`R-Hacks` is powered by the `Rome R Users Group` community.
We collect clever ideas, handy functions, and small daily discoveries shared during meetups or projects. The goal is to create a living library of high-impact examples that reflect what people actually use in their analysis—not theoretical snippets, but real solutions to real problems.
