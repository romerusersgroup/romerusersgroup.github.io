    "section": "Exploratory Data Analysis Workflow",
    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis Workflow\nHere is a short, practical guide showing how to recreate this plot.\nStep 0: Start from a basic dataframe\nIn most real situations you will already have a dataframe to work with. Here is the one used in this example:\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  league = c(\"Premier League\", \"La Liga\", \n             \"Serie A\", \"Bundesliga\", \"Ligue 1\"),\n  goals  = c(1197, 977, 968, 960, 804))\n\ndf\n\n          league goals\n1 Premier League  1197\n2        La Liga   977\n3        Serie A   968\n4     Bundesliga   960\n5        Ligue 1   804\n\n\nStep 1: Choose the images you want to display (PNG recommended)\nFirst decide which images you want to show on your ggplot axis. In this example I am using online image URLs (including links from Wikimedia), but you can use any source that provides a direct image URL, such as files hosted on GitHub repos or any public static hosting service. Just make sure the image format is supported — typically PNG or JPG/JPEG.\n\n# Define image URLs as variables\npremier_url &lt;- \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/6/6d/Premier_League_Logo_2016.png\"\nlaliga_url &lt;- \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/9/9b/LFP_La_Liga.png\"\nseriea_url &lt;- \"https://www.fifplay.com/img/public/serie-a-logo.png\"\nbundes_url &lt;- \"https://www.fifplay.com/img/public/bundesliga-logo.png\"\nligue1_url &lt;- \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Ligue_1_2024_Logo.png\"\n\nStep 2: Add a column with HTML  tags\nIn order to display images on the axis, each image URL must be wrapped inside an HTML  tag. This simply means that the URL cannot appear alone — it must be placed inside the structure:\n`&lt;img src= + image_url + width='45'/&gt;`\nPlease note that in this example I use width=‘45’ just as a reference size, but you can choose any value depending on how big you want the image to appear in your plot.\nLet’s add the column to the df:\n\ndf$logo &lt;- c(\n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", premier_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\"), \n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", laliga_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\"), \n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", seriea_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\"), \n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", bundes_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\"), \n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", ligue1_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\")\n  )\n\nAt this point, the dataframe should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleague\ngoals\nlogo\n\n\n\nPremier League\n1197\n&lt;img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/6/6d/Premier_League_Logo_2016.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\nLa Liga\n977\n&lt;img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/9/9b/LFP_La_Liga.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\nSerie A\n968\n&lt;img src='https://www.fifplay.com/img/public/serie-a-logo.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\nBundesliga\n960\n&lt;img src='https://www.fifplay.com/img/public/bundesliga-logo.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\nLigue 1\n804\n&lt;img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Ligue_1_2024_Logo.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Plot your data!\nNow that the dataframe contains a column of HTML  tags, we can use it directly on the x-axis. The key part is here:\n\ntheme( axis.text.x = element_markdown() )\n\nelement_markdown() function is what allows ggplot to interpret the HTML in your axis labels. Without it, ggplot would show the literal string &lt;img src='...'&gt; as plain text. With it, the &lt;img&gt; tags are rendered as actual images.\nHere is the full plotting code:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\noptions(repr.plot.width = 6, \n        repr.plot.height = 7, \n        warn = -1)\n\n\nggplot(df, \n       aes(x = reorder(logo, -goals), y = goals)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"forestgreen\", width = .8) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = goals), vjust = -0.5, size = 4.5) + \n  labs(title = \"\\nFootball stats 2023/2024\",\n       subtitle = \"Total Goals scored in each League\\n\" ) + \n  theme_minimal(14) +\n  # HTML rendering happens here!!\n  theme(axis.text.x = ggtext::element_markdown(), \n         axis.text.y = element_blank(), \n         panel.grid = element_blank(), \n         axis.title = element_blank(), \n         plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", \n                                   colour = \"blue\", hjust = 0.05), \n         plot.subtitle= element_text(hjust = 0.05)\n         )\n\nWith element_markdown() applied to axis.text.x, ggplot correctly displays the league logos instead of plain text labels, as seen in the barchart above.\nTo Recap\n\nPrepare your dataframe (existing or new)\nChoose your images (PNG recommended) and store their URLs\nWrap each URL inside an HTML tag with a defined width\nAdd this HTML column to your dataframe\nMap it to the ggplot axis\nEnable HTML rendering in plot theme using:\n\n\naxis.text.x = ggtext::element_markdown()\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to stay up to date with the latest events from the Rome R Users Group, click here:\n👉https://www.meetup.com/rome-r-users-group/\nAnd if you are curious, the full Kaggle notebook used for this tip is available here: 🔗https://www.kaggle.com/code/lcolon/football-2023-2024-eda-and-pa-with-logos"

From quick ggplot adjustments to clever data wrangling patterns, each snippet is built to be copied, adapted, and used immediately in your own analysis.\nBeyond simple tricks, the blog highlights efficient ways of thinking about data. You’ll find micro-workflows that combine tidyverse tools, reproducible visualisation techniques, and small utilities that make routine tasks easier. Every post aims to help you write cleaner, faster, and more robust R code by adopting sensible, modern practices.\nR-Hacks is powered by the Rome R Users Group community. We collect clever ideas, handy functions, and small daily discoveries shared during meetups or projects. The goal is to create a living library of high-impact examples that reflect what people actually use in their analysis—not theoretical snippets, but real solutions to real problems."

    "text": "Overview\nOn November 27, the Rome R Users Group hosted a special workshop led by Jakub Nowosad, one of the most recognized voices in the R spatial community. More than 200 participants registered for the event, marking one of our largest and most engaging sessions to date. For those who couldn’t attend live, or who wish to revisit the material—this page includes the recording and all essential information so you can follow the workshop at your own pace.\n\nA Deep Dive into Geospatial Predictive Mapping\nThe workshop focused on practical workflows for building reliable spatial predictions in R. Much of the discussion revolved around the challenges of predicting spatial patterns in real-world contexts, where data often contain gaps, biases, or irregular sampling.\nJakub demonstrated how R can be used not only to model such data but also to valuate model performance spatially and visualize results in ways that highlight both strengths and limitations. Concepts like spatial cross-validation, the Area of Applicability (AoA), and prediction-domain adaptive diagnostics were explained clearly, illustrating why traditional modeling approaches often fall short when applied to geographic problems.\nThroughout the session, participants followed concrete examples showing how various R packages, such as {sf}, {terra}, {CAST} and several visualization tools, including {tmap}, work together within a workflow. The emphasis is on reproducibility and transparent code. The workshop is particularly valuable for practitioners working in environmental analysis, ecology, remote sensing, and related fields."

    "section": "What Participants Learned",
    "text": "What Participants Learned\nRather than treating geospatial modeling as a sequence of isolated steps, Jakub encouraged a holistic perspective. Participants saw how the process begins with understanding the structure and quality of spatial data, continues through careful model training and selection, and culminates in interpreting predictions within their geographical context.\nParticular attention was given to the pitfalls that arise when spatial structure is ignored—for example, overly optimistic accuracy metrics or unrealistic prediction maps. Jakub explained how spatially aware resampling strategies lead to more reliable evaluations and how tools like the AoA metric help determine where a model should or should not be trusted.\nVisualisation was another central theme. The workshop demonstrated how thoughtful map design can communicate both predictions and associated uncertainties, promoting transparent and responsible modeling."
