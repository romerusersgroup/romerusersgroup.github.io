    "section": "Exploratory Data Analysis Workflow",
    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis Workflow\nHere is a short, practical guide showing how to recreate this plot.\nStep 0: Start from a basic dataframe\nIn most real situations you will already have a dataframe to work with. Here is the one used in this example:\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  league = c(\"Premier League\", \"La Liga\", \n             \"Serie A\", \"Bundesliga\", \"Ligue 1\"),\n  goals  = c(1197, 977, 968, 960, 804))\n\ndf\n\n          league goals\n1 Premier League  1197\n2        La Liga   977\n3        Serie A   968\n4     Bundesliga   960\n5        Ligue 1   804\n\n\nStep 1: Choose the images you want to display (PNG recommended)\nFirst decide which images you want to show on your ggplot axis. In this example I am using online image URLs (including links from Wikimedia), but you can use any source that provides a direct image URL, such as files hosted on GitHub repos or any public static hosting service. Just make sure the image format is supported — typically PNG or JPG/JPEG.\n\n# Define image URLs as variables\npremier_url &lt;- \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/6/6d/Premier_League_Logo_2016.png\"\nlaliga_url &lt;- \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/9/9b/LFP_La_Liga.png\"\nseriea_url &lt;- \"https://www.fifplay.com/img/public/serie-a-logo.png\"\nbundes_url &lt;- \"https://www.fifplay.com/img/public/bundesliga-logo.png\"\nligue1_url &lt;- \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Ligue_1_2024_Logo.png\"\n\nStep 2: Add a column with HTML  tags\nIn order to display images on the axis, each image URL must be wrapped inside an HTML  tag. This simply means that the URL cannot appear alone — it must be placed inside the structure:\n`&lt;img src= + image_url + width='45'/&gt;`\nPlease note that in this example I use width=‘45’ just as a reference size, but you can choose any value depending on how big you want the image to appear in your plot.\nLet’s add the column to the df:\n\ndf$logo &lt;- c(\n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", premier_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\"), \n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", laliga_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\"), \n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", seriea_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\"), \n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", bundes_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\"), \n  paste0(\"&lt;img src='\", ligue1_url, \"' width='45'/&gt;\")\n  )\n\nAt this point, the dataframe should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleague\ngoals\nlogo\n\n\n\nPremier League\n1197\n&lt;img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/6/6d/Premier_League_Logo_2016.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\nLa Liga\n977\n&lt;img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/9/9b/LFP_La_Liga.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\nSerie A\n968\n&lt;img src='https://www.fifplay.com/img/public/serie-a-logo.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\nBundesliga\n960\n&lt;img src='https://www.fifplay.com/img/public/bundesliga-logo.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\nLigue 1\n804\n&lt;img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Ligue_1_2024_Logo.png' width='45'/&gt;\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Plot your data!\nNow that the dataframe contains a column of HTML  tags, we can use it directly on the x-axis. The key part is here:\n\ntheme( axis.text.x = element_markdown() )\n\nelement_markdown() function is what allows ggplot to interpret the HTML in your axis labels. Without it, ggplot would show the literal string &lt;img src='...'&gt; as plain text. With it, the &lt;img&gt; tags are rendered as actual images.\nHere is the full plotting code:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\noptions(repr.plot.width = 6, \n        repr.plot.height = 7, \n        warn = -1)\n\n\nggplot(df, \n       aes(x = reorder(logo, -goals), y = goals)) + \n  geom_col(fill = \"forestgreen\", width = .8) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = goals), vjust = -0.5, size = 4.5) + \n  labs(title = \"\\nFootball stats 2023/2024\",\n       subtitle = \"Total Goals scored in each League\\n\" ) + \n  theme_minimal(14) +\n  # HTML rendering happens here!!\n  theme(axis.text.x = ggtext::element_markdown(), \n         axis.text.y = element_blank(), \n         panel.grid = element_blank(), \n         axis.title = element_blank(), \n         plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", \n                                   colour = \"blue\", hjust = 0.05), \n         plot.subtitle= element_text(hjust = 0.05)\n         )\n\nWith element_markdown() applied to axis.text.x, ggplot correctly displays the league logos instead of plain text labels, as seen in the barchart above.\nTo Recap\n\nPrepare your dataframe (existing or new)\nChoose your images (PNG recommended) and store their URLs\nWrap each URL inside an HTML tag with a defined width\nAdd this HTML column to your dataframe\nMap it to the ggplot axis\nEnable HTML rendering in plot theme using:\n\n\naxis.text.x = ggtext::element_markdown()\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to stay up to date with the latest events from the Rome R Users Group, click here:\n👉https://www.meetup.com/rome-r-users-group/\nAnd if you are curious, the full Kaggle notebook used for this tip is available here: 🔗https://www.kaggle.com/code/lcolon/football-2023-2024-eda-and-pa-with-logos"
