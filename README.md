# Welcome to the Rome R Users Group

*Local Chapter of R User Groups*

The [Rome R Users Group](https://romerusersgroup.github.io/) is a community for anyone curious, passionate, or simply **R-curious**. We meet in **Rome** to learn, share ideas, build skills, and connect with people who use R for work, research, creativity, and fun. Whether starting out or already deep into statistical **modelling** and **geospatial** pipelines, there is space here to explore **new tools** and meet others who enjoy data as much as you do.

Our events range from **hands-on workshops** to invited talks with international speakers, **community-led sessions**, **project showcases**, and **informal meetups**. Every gathering is designed to be practical, welcoming, and openly accessible. <ins>*We believe in open science, reproducible workflows, and collaborative learning—and we build our activities around these values.*</ins>

We aim to bring together **students**, **researchers**, **professionals**, and anyone who wants to grow their skills in **programming**, **statistics**, **machine learning**, **visualisation**, **public health**, **geospatial** analysis, and everything R makes possible. <ins>*No matter your background, you will find people here who share your interests, your questions, and your excitement to learn.*</ins>

Together with [R-Ladies Rome](https://rladiesrome.org/), we are building a vibrant **in-person** community in the city: a place to meet, exchange ideas, discover opportunities, and create connections that go beyond a single event. Our goal is simple <ins>*help more people in Rome find each other, learn together, and build something meaningful.*</ins>

Join an event, follow the page, or reach out if you would like to speak, collaborate, or propose a topic. If you enjoy R, learning, or meeting interesting people, you will fit right in.
